ECB made a report about alternative virtual currencies
http://blog.bitinstant.com/blog/2012/10/30/the-ecb-report-on-bitcoin-and-virtual-currencies.html
This seriously sounds like the story about "Wï¿½rgl Freigeld" -
Austrian regional currency, which saved Wï¿½rgl from
the consequences of the world wide recession.
Later, the Austrian central bank forbid the Freigeld
and armed forces were sent for accomplishment in September 1933.

Hello,
As I perceived, my stories about couchsurfing sounded a bit weird to you.
However, if you still don't believe, you can read for "brief" summary here:

In order to fight Bitcoin, p2p spying plus anti-Bitcoin laws are 
actually enough.
BUT
If the current conventional money suppliers want to fight bitcoin,
they need to pay their mercenaries (the p2p spying companies and police).
But mercenaries could be also paid by Bitcoin. What
if the corporate military will accept bitcoins as they accept dollars?
It is like Russian Civil War 1917-22. Every region controlled by faction
had it own fiat money and mercenaries enforced the acceptance
of the money, they were paid in.

 From Wikipedia:
Pouya (Listen /ËˆPu:ja/ Puja) is a character in the Data Mining books by 
A. A. Milne.
He is generally characterized as a pessimistic, gloomy, depressed, 
anhedonic,
old grey stuffed donkey who is a friend of the title character, Neuronal 
Network.
Unfortunately, he finds his death being watering by petrol.

Today, I've got a very strange message from a British girl called Helana:
"Dear Yepkio.
The black storis meetup is at my house tomorrow but after we met at the 
Essen Games Fair i would not be happy to have you in my home.
You were very rude to me and you talked to me in a very disrespectful 
way and because of that i do not want you to come to the meetup tomorrow.
I will take you off the list for black stories. You can stay in th Dgmg 
and go to meetups but i am not happy to have you in my home.
Helana"
I wrote her that I did not make an exception for her. Therefore, it was 
not my intention.


Ok, on a Boards Games Conventions in Essen,
we played a very stupid Finnish board game with her.
She is an unattractive and therefore unsatisfied British girl,
who is into board games as way to escape the her loser existence.
Well, I'm a friend of direct truth, whether or not it causes cognitive 
dissonance.
She should understand that demanding ï¿½ber-respect from male counterparts
is a contrary to satisfaction of her sexual needs.
And I finally a nice "Do it" here:

And again, why distract from the topic all of the time? Oh it must hurt you
so much that you can't stand it, can't finish it. Face it, nobody is always
right. Not even (or especially) people who are self-absorbed. But they have
to distract from the topic as soon as their delusion is endangered.
Thanks wise guy.
I just left a political organization for reasons I won't tell you. I also
used to be member of the youth organization of another political
organization until I grew too old. Thanks for the proof that you know
nothing about me! (If any proof was needed).
Have you read Don Quichote? See, I didn't think so. So stop making such
silly comments.
I don't need your help at all. Should I need help or rather support I can
fall back on my well educated and behaved friends who have the right morals
and are a pleasure to stay or discuss with.
I know the (or some) sources of cruelties, thanks. But I am not declined to
generalize the way you do. Not everybody who's had a difficult childhood
turns out to be a serial killer. In reality only a small minority of those
who've had difficult childhoods turn out to be serial killers.
Tell me when they've imprisoned you. I may visit you as a 'Seelsorger'.
I don't think that everybody who behaves badly is in his or her heart of
hearts a bad person. But still I try to avoid such bad company.
Don't know what "Extension du domaine de la lutte" is. Surely not a
psychological thesis or something. Got nothing to do with geoecology
either. Never heard of it. And I hardly speak French so I won't go into
whatever thesis you now provide to distract from the initial problem. I
find it rather boring and annoying that you can't finish a topic as soon as
it gets complicated for you or your arguments are debunked. If you write
programmes the way you discuss, then none of your codes work.

that you are very intelligent and a master of logic, but this 'logic' has

time to have a coffee with you. Hence it is possible to comment on the
impression gained in such a situation. Unfortunately I have spent more time
than that with you so I think I am in a good position to leave a comment.
And it surely is legitimate. Anyway, after last Thursday I don't think that
you are entitled to tell others what is appropriate and what isn't.

join you on hatebook.

had any they could be 'feeling sorry for you' or 'feeling sympathy for
you'. May I suggest that I'd rather feel disgust in the sense of 'Ekel'
towards you. Hardly hate, eh. That said I'd suggest that you don't make any
more silly assumptions without proof. Further down the line you may chose
to stick to your word and don't judge others (remember, yesterday you wrote
that you are not in a position to judge others).
>>>>
>>>>Ah, next sentence in your comment, next twist. No, I don't want to
suggest that I studied social pedagogy. You mix up Frank and me again. He
studies that subject. I studied something else before I came here, but
that's not up to debate. So, all in all you don't know if, what, when,
where or why I studied, worked and lived before I came to Freiberg. Simple
as that. So don't make any assumptions in that regard. May I point out that
not every information you find on the web is true. I think you accidentally
overheard a clue about someone's age, a quite rough one though.

you credit me with everything anybody has said or done last week.
>>>>
>>>>Ok, here we go again. May I ask you how you get the idea that I am very
emotional? Come on. You simply don't know it. You mix up Frank and me again
here. Everything I have written about you are FACTS, things you have said,
done and made people (not only me) believe. Your comment doesn't reflect
positively on you because it comes across as revenge. Stick to facts. Tell
me when I reacted emotionally towards you (I know ONE instance! Do you know
it too?). After you had left, my flat-mates at the time told me that they
had hoped that I would react emotionally and throw you out, but I didn't.
Did you realize that? So, again, how come you can say that I am very
emotional? Or is it just a tit-for-tat response, albeit in blind anger?
>>>>
>>>>Hm, I am not constructive in my emotional reactions. Well, as described
above I didn't react emotionally otherwise you would have been thrown out
of the flat. That would have been very constructive for all my other guests.
>>>>
>>>>As I said above, I know one instance where I reacted emotionally
(although not very) to some of the crap theories that came out of you mouth
that evening. I even know why I reacted emotionally. Not constructive, eh.
Thing is that every time someone brought up a valid argument or tried
something else constructive, you've changed the topic. I think we both know
that you did that because you have (had) an agenda of being negative (at
least that evening) and provocative, to upset everybody in order to feel
better yourself, because you obviously couldn't stand it that people were
enjoying themselves before you interfered. You didn't allow anybody to be
constructive so how could you judge whether or not someone is constructive.
You were the destructive instance that night, remember that.
>>>>
>>>>Your opinions may be independent, but my left-wing, humanist,
intellectual surroundings prefer to distance themselves from mass murder,
cannibalism, rape, genocide and all the other negative topics you tried to
'discuss' that evening. And when I say 'distance themselves' it means that
they and I can of course be interested in why people commit crimes etc.,
but we then consider the action (e.g. murder or rape) as wrong,
inappropriate under any circumstances and make it clear to ourselves that
we don't want to or even can do such things. You continually failed to
distance yourself from these things, but rather gave the impression that
you find these things pretty cool (to put it in your language).
>>>>
>>>>After all you can count yourself luck with the comment I have left for
you, because I think that you will one day commit one of the following
crimes: Rape, child abuse, owning child pornography, running riot, serial
murder. Good impression you've left here, really. I did not write this,
because these are my assumptions and I have no proof yet that any of these
things may happen or have already happened. You can also count yourself
lucky that I didn't report you to the police. You have claimed, in front of
several independent witnesses, that you are planning to hack into the
data-base of the German authorities to change your place of birth. I don't
think that you will succeed with this plan and therefore I will not tell it
anybody. As you may now have noticed, I based my comment purely on facts
and left out assumptions and such. Very much in contrast to your comment.
>>>>
>>>>While I don't believe this will be the case, the other guests told me
that they think that one day you may well develop further and truly feel
sorry for spreading negativity amongst us (and develop a consideration for
others). In that sense I wish you all the best. Should you ever truly
regret what you did because you've understood it, please feel free to
apologize, but please spare me your not even half-hearted 'sorry'. You
know, I too had to learn to apologize for my wrongdoings. Of course this
has happened long before I turned 27, but trust me, first it is hard,
because you have to honestly admit that you did something wrong. In the end
it is very rewarding as usually a honest apology is welcomed warmly by most
people. The ability to say sorry is surely one trait even a person working
with computers could do with. By the way, there was no need to study social
pedagogics to find this out. Life teaches things like that within time, but
only if one wants to learn. You have, so far, not made the impression of
someone willing to change one bit, because you appear to be so convinced of
yourself that it is sickening. Self-deception springs to mind.

I went to okcupid.com again and created there a fake Frankenstein

There are so many rapists sending me messages now. I had to troll around 
with these imbeciles
ending by "Go, fist youself!" or "If you are upset, bang your sister!"
Whenever I replied something stupid, they always tried to agree ... only 
because I have a pussy?
Total morons! They don't understand that women need self-confident men.
How can I find a man attractive, who begs me for sex?

Baraki, Iï¿½d like to strip you down and butter you like a slice of 
wonderbread, and shave your armpits, and pour honey all over your naked 
body. And for the next two weeks pretend I was a..hungry bear.
Read what a rejected transvestite writes me, who almost fooled me into a 
real life date:
"mein lieber verwirrender troll, was ist denn nun eigentlich los 
gewesen...ich bin nicht groï¿½ bï¿½se, ich hatte heute auch so einen sehr 
schï¿½nen tag am wasser...ich bin auch generell nicht der typ der ohne 
Verstï¿½ndnis darauf reagiert, wenn mir jemand absagt, weil doch etwas 
dazwischengekommen ist oder einem etwas zuviel geworden ist, oder weil 
man sich geï¿½rgert hat etc... nur mag ich ehrlichkeit in solchen Momenten 
schon sehr gerne, gerade weil du jemand bist, den ich begonnen habe ganz 
unverbindlich und ohne groï¿½e Erwartungen an dich zu mï¿½gen. Ich hatte 
mich einfach auf die Radtour gefreut...
nun weiï¿½ ich unangenehmer Weise nicht wie ich deine Reaktionen gestern 
verstehen soll... ich bin ja kein Data scientist oder mentalist...
sag mir doch einfach was war oder ist.. davon wird die Welt doch nicht 
untergehen, aber dafï¿½r bleiben einem positiver Weise dann ein paar 
weniger Fragezeichen unklar im Kopf hï¿½ngen...und wenn deine Antwort sein 
sollte, dass du dich gerne ein bisschen ins Leben anderer trollst und 
dann schnell wieder raustrollst mit Strategie... -ich weiï¿½, das wird 
dich auch ï¿½rgern- ...es ist kein Beinbruch fï¿½r mich in meinem 
Empfinden...so oder so fand ich unsere Kommunikation sehr nett..."
Photos of "it" are in attachment!
There are 3 things, which made me suspicious over the last days of 
communication:
1) No power games like I expect from real women.
2) No mood up and downs.
3) And this clear "begging"-behaviour, which I expect from women, which 
have already experienced my sexual performance.
They always beg for a repetition after the first time and THEY NEVER BEG 
SO OPENLY IN ADVANCE, BECAUSE THEY FEAR TO MUCH TO BE REJECTED!

Pouya calling police must sound like this "They rape everybody ..." -video

Ok, I apologize for my language, which could irritate you like it did 
with Pouya.
Actually not, Alan. The typical female behaviour with power games and 
mood fluctuations, which I'm used to, ignites love in me,
although I complain about it. The absence of suffering was a turn-off. I 
learnt something important out of this.

Alan, call Anna and tell her about me! Tell her that she will never 
regret and it's for free!
And you can call me now "Schwanzknochen" instead of "Schwarzknochen", 
since I did not get laid since I work at this ***** company.

talking about things you don't understand!
Exactly, good example proving my thesis.

Ah ... you can not be trusted. Good to know before things get serious!
Pouya, I regret to have clicked your stupidities!

Dear friends
Because I worried about Fabian's mood, I called him this Sunday.
He stated to feel good. I explained him that some past processes at our 
com.
destroyed our faith in its**success. We are not purely motivated by 
myopic payoff.
And I tell that to him in a calm and considerate way in order to prevent 
hurt.
I said that on Monday, radical changes have to be agreed in order
to regain our motivation and that there is no room for procrastination 
or also
yet another demotivating months of sick work environment.
We strongly believe that this com. will success, but only if radical 
changes occur.
He replied that we can freely forward our objection to the person, who 
finances the com.

Best Regards

Thank you, Alan.
Pouya, I did not mention to Fabian that we cogitate it before he said it 
himself.

"not working hard enough" - Yes, Fabian started with that.
Pouya, there is no such word "impossible". It mostly means "I don't want".
Only a profitable company can spill out proper bonuses.

A number of past processes at our company, which are listed below,
destroyed our faith in its success. We are not purely motivated by myopic
payoff. Radical changes have to be agreed in order to regain our
motivation. And since our motivation is the key for the success, there is
no room for procrastination and yet another demotivating months of status
quo. We strongly believe that Qlaym will success, but only if radical
changes occur. The suggestions for the solution are presented after the
description of the problems.

 It is widely known that validation is necessary to deliver any reliable or
actionable results from data mining. In spite of it, it took months to
explain to and to convince the management of this trivial fact. The
complete unawareness and ignorance of the management to existence of
state-of-art data mining packages like Weka, Shogun etc., which caused the
development of Oqtopus like “reinventing the wheel”. The elaboration of
sophisticated marketing concepts causes more work than it is believed by
the management, and therefore is inefficient in comparison to bold
state-of-art techniques. It also sabotages trust of the customer – a 400
pages report did not bring sequel in Hoesch project. This and other yet not
solved issues costed and cost time, energy and money. Using Weka, it took
only two days to find out that a static model is not applicable in the case
of Eon. Finding the solution for SEC 600, namely “WD_oben-WD_unten” took
two days using Weka. The degree of interference from the management in
algorithm's design is unacceptable, especially since parts of the
management are unaware even about the simplest decision tree generating
algorithms.

 We are sure that reliable and reputation building results can be delivered
using state-of-art methods in a fraction of time. The computer
infrastructure should allow fast installation of open-source libraries, as
we use to have it in our free time projects. The difference of the mindsets
between us and the rest of company should be reflected in company's
structure and budgets.
This weekend, I installed forecast on my computer, which took me 30 min.
Then, I tried to predict the couchsurfing signup data, which I secured 
in August 2011. (cs.csv)
It is a times series from 2004 on having 400 weeks.
The result of the forecast is embarrassing. (forecastcs.png)
I fitted a seasonal exponential to it on the end (c$.png)
More results are on the end of this thread

"In 2008 approximately one in every 31 adults (7.3 million) in the 
United States was behind bars, or being monitored (probation and 
parole). In 2008 the breakdown for adults under correctional control was 
as follows: one out of 18 men, one in 89 women, one in 11 
African-Americans (9.2 percent), one in 27 Latinos (3.7 percent), and 
one in 45 Caucasians (2.2 percent)."
So, the highest rate is for male African-Americans  .... I wonder Obama 
became a president.

I especially like this quote:
"They first mature into males, but then switch sexes to become females. 
The magic starts when more than one /C. exigua/ lands in a given fish's 
gills. When the first one infiltrates it begins to mature into a male, 
but when the second one appears, said Brusca, it "stimulates the first 
one to change sex and become a female and crawl from the gills up 
through the throat and attach to the tongue, and then this new second 
one is the male that will impregnate her." "

I found such a nice blog:
http://www.cyclingscholar.com/danger.html
My personal favourites are
1) "Readers of my travel chronicles know that I was being chased by
three Rottweilers near Chichistina, Alaska when the dogs ran into the
road to get at me. One was killed, another one severely injured by an
oncoming Winnebago in one of the most spectacular accidents I have ever
seen while cycling."
Mhhh, fresh meat!
2) "By the way, if you have access to a can of WD-40, the petroleum
product in it will clog the bees breathing passages (turning the
tables!!!!) and theyÂ´ll leave you alone."
I have always been a fan of WD-40!
3) "I can tell you there is one teenage kid in Nicaragua who got a very
sharp welt on the forehad as a result of this whip that I had. That is
the ONLY time I had to use it directly, although at two other roadblocks
(both in Ecuador) I brought it out and whipped it in the air."
Whipping a kid ... ohh
Actually, I checked crime levels in South America and Argentina has the
same level as US.
Well, Brazil is a war zone. Especially, the areas around big cities  ...

Dr. James Elmer Mitchell, The American Joseph Mengele ... Designing a
torture program - a dream job!
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/18/james-mitchell-cia-torture-interview
Friday is without me.
Actually, for setting up an experiment to prove whether coercion works
or not, non-terrorists are required as a control group. So,
innocents should be tortured for the progress of the technology.
I think about text mining the Guantanamo files, clustering the people.
There might be some room for optimization. The future governing
system is pretty clear to me and also inevitable -
a small elite will use technology to control the majority.
The question is not to avoid torture, but to get on the torturers' side
rather than on the tortured side.
You accidentally shot it down and don't want to take responsibility.

I missed to add Pouya's name on this list:
"More than 52,000 Russians have put their signatures under an appeal to

I met a Czech IT PHD-student in Spain, who is writing while walking to

decided to resell drugs to tourists, got caught, spent 3 days in prison and
got deported. He can not enter Marroco for six years since then.

Oh Pouya, I did not know! That is, why you dream about becoming MP ...
joining the secret circles and orgies.
>From wikipedia: "It is punishable "to recruit" German citizens "for
military duty in a military or military-like facility in support of a
foreign power" (Section-sign StGB). Furthermore, a German risks the loss of
his citizenship, if he enlists in an armed force of a state he is also
citizen of (Section-sign StAG)."
OK, I met somebody in Portugal (in a village bar) who made a Marcel-style
advertisement for his company: "35 men trained by him fixed an entire
airport in Crimea!" (Putin hired mercs). He even wrote down their address
in Sierra Leone. The guy had Fjelraven jacket -- not a crazy bum.
Rustam, you should love the big news story in America now. An American
soldier left his base and tried to join the Taliban. They wouldn't let him
join, and instead they held him captive and raped him for 5 years.  Then
Obama released 5 Taliban commanders to get him back.
Wins all around.

I always meet people sitting on the road and selling fruits. But,
yesterday, there was a girl sitting without fruits on the street. I started
communication, but she did not speak English. Well, then, she showed me on
hands, what she was actually selling. Oh shit, I was not prepared.
... damsel in distress
Yesterday, I took out a dirty T-shirt and it had a very interesting smell
after spending days in my hot panier. It fermented.
Barbecue in Volksgarten ... very creative
Southern Portugal, Alan. I just taught my hostess, how to make Azeri
watermelon marmalade. @Pouya: It is Azeri, not Iranian. You learnt from us.

I welcome him to Africa.
I am in Marrakesh now. I bought hand made Italian leather shoes in
Casablanca for 27 Euros. Yesterday, I made 195 km through Marroco's Marsian
landscapes. Then, police hosted me and shared their meal with me. But,
Marroco is still too European - they even have female Policemen.
Pouya remembers everything or maybe just only everything about me.
Actually, I have now the same appetite as Pouya. We could make this trip as
a couple.
Alan, Bielefeld is like division by null or Pouya's girl friend. I crossed
the high atlas and thought about the other mountains, the ones under his
T-shirt.
In Sahara, we are making 200km a day with tail wind though nowhere. 35 km
per hour. Wet tents in the morning. Heat in the afternoon. Me, English and

Ok Pouya. You are so intelligent to send a video as attachment.
Oh, the Mauretanian border police man was very impressed yesterday that I
crossed his country in 5 days on bicycle. He started to call all his
colleges. I did not tell him the reason of my speedup. Senegal looks like
Europe compared to Mauretania. They have no washining machines , black outs
and subsequently offline in the capitol. I had to pay a Mauretanian to wash
my underwear by hand - he was happy.
Aggggggggression!!

Wait ... A Russian car crash video as email attachment? Since me and Alan
left, Pouya seems to mentally decline. He will become an amoebae in less
than a year. He will eat, eat, eat and then split in two ... Pouyas. And
then again. That is how his procreation problem will be solved.

Regarding your article about Sam Israel ... Yes, all four millioners, I had
the opportunity to have long conversations with shared the same mentality.
They measure intelligence by money and therefore distrust official science,
because it is cheap. They are very sensitive to alternative theories,
conspiracy theories. The main stream theories might be a fraud set up by
billioners according to millioners' opinion - billioners and millioners are
not the same. People like Sam Israel prove their intelligence by faking
profit, mostly stock market prediction, and bash on billioners.
Oh shit! I just googled for Sam Israel .... this article is true? :-O Life
is absurd. My credit card got blocked punctually to my birthday, because
some asshole tried to empty it as my bank tells. I replaced my brooks
saddle, so I have some money to survive in the Andes.
Alan, ohhh ... you still did not get that there are many people like me in

capybaras and share them .... egoist me! :-(

Aha! Actually, I worked with a ten years old cyber glove in 2008. Back
then, it was pretty easy to create a training set for nine gestures. Then,
using Weka, I could make a glove based gaming input device. Out of 10
students, only one girls' hand was not of appropriate size to use it - to
damn small. Well, my problem with this glove - How to fix bending sensors
on skin without using robber bondage? And in case of Gringos, there is
always a thick layer of fat between skin and everything else. I suggest to
some how track the bones.
PS: Look at this link

I am surprised that you are surprised.
Do you actually know the kinesio taping? Could the bending-sensor sticked
the same way? I guess it was too thick to stay long on skin and would
detach pretty fast.
Ok. Taping and moviment tracking sounds like a lot of fun, especially with

I met her, Papa Schlupf's friend, the skinny brunette prostitute, he knows
from Canada. It did really wonder me, how Papa Schlupf and a prostitute can
be friends, not even a couple. She has a little kid now, but still looks
pretty. I asked her about, how they met and she answered "He focked me five
times.".  "focked", not "fucked" :? Wow .... two soulmates becoming friends
after a deal.
"webside", not "website" ... Language is bent by the absurdity if life.

>>> During the reign of Attila, the Huns were already in Europe. China would
have been a massive shlep.
Attila reigned over the Huns from 434 CE to 453. We don't know when exactly
he was born, but it's generally theorized that the earliest would have been
390. The Huns had already crossed the Volga in the 370's. So about twenty
years before when we think Attila was born, the Huns were already west of
that river. Getting to China would have meant going quite a bit of
distance. We don't know precisely how far west of the Volga Attila was
born, but because Attila's brother Bleda had a distinctly Germanic name,
it's thought Attila was born not too far from the Danube River. In any
event, by the time Attila came of age, the Huns were an established power
in Europe. The Romans were paying them to fight Germanic tribes in the
area, which the Huns viewed as the Romans paying tribute.
This was an unstable state of affairs - the Romans' attempt to pay
barbarians to fight each other frequently ended badly for the Romans, with
the 378 Battle of Adrianople resulting from an attempt to do so with the
Goths. At that battle, the Eastern Roman Emperor, Valens, was killed along
with somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000 Roman soldiers. This actually left
the Eastern Roman Empire unable to help out the Western Roman Empire, which
was itself in even worse condition.
So when Attila came to the Hunnic throne, he had two wealthy, but not
particularly strong, empires to loot right on his borders. Invading China
for Attila would have meant either going through some not especially
wealthy parts of Central Asia or else going through the Sasanian Empire,
which was doing reasonably well for itself. After that, it would have meant
going through either Xinjiang or Tibet to finally attack the Chinese
heartland - neither of which have traditionally been particularly good
invasion routes.
This wasn't a particularly difficult decision. After first menacing the
Eastern Roman Empire to ensure that it remained neutral (and that it paid
tribute), Attila started attacking the Western Roman Empire, first in Gaul,
then in Italy itself. The campaign in Gaul devastated the area, but was
ended by a Roman-Gothic alliance at the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields.
The Italian campaign, on the other hand, ended for reasons known only to
Attila himself.
As for why the Huns moved west before Attila, this is unclear - as indeed
are most things about the Huns in general. The first anyone who bothered
writing anything down heard of them was sometime between 1 and 100 CE, at
which point, they were already near the Caspian Sea. There is a theory that
the Huns were descended from an ethnic group known as the Xiongnu, who had
been chased out of northern Central Asia by the Han dynasty about a century
prior, but this theory is far from universally accepted.
No, because you made fun of Rumanians! Since couples days, I totally agree
with Bogdan regarding gipsies. Therefore, I am almost Rumanian.
RASHID AL-DIN (Fazlallah Tabib al-Hamdani, "the physician from Hamadan";
1247â€“1318). He was born to Jewish parents in *Hamadan. He was the son of
Ê¿ImÄd al-Dawla b. Abu al-Khayr, a pharmacist by profession. We do not have
any knowledge of the early periods of his life until we hear of him
entering the service of the Ilkhan Abaqa (r. 1265â€“1282), the second *Mongol
Emperor, as a physician. We are informed from some early sources that he
had embraced Islam around the year 1278, when he was 30 years old. Twenty
years later, namely around 1298, Rashid al-Din became a deputy to Sadr
al-Din ZanjÄni, the vizier of Arghun's son, Ghazan Khan (r. 1295â€“1304). A
few months later, Sadr al-Din was put to death and his place was taken by
SaÊ¿d al-Din SÄvaji who made Rashid al-Din his associate. In this capacity
Rashid al-Din introduced substantial administrative reforms during Ghazan's
reign. He amassed tremendous power and wealth and owned property in almost
every corner of the Mongol Empire. Eight of his 14 sons were appointed
governors of provinces. As the associate of the SÄhib DivÄn, mostly using
his fortune he built madrasa s, hospitals, and other public and educational
institutions in many places in the empire, especially in the capital city
of *Tabriz and in the nearby city, SultÄniyya. In the suburb of Tabriz he
constructed a little town, called by his name RabÊ¿-i Rashidi, to which he
brought intellectuals and artists from different Islamic lands.
In TÄrikh-i Uljeitu, composed by Ê¿Abdallah KÄshÄni (d. 1337), we read about
a bitter debate which took place between Rashid al-Din and SaÊ¿d al-Din
SÄvaji in the presence of the Uljeitu. SaÊ¿d al-Din vilified Rashid al-Din
with abusive words and called him a Jew (1969:121ff.). For this impudent
behavior, SaÊ¿d al-Din was dismissed from the office of the SÄhib DivÄn and
was put to death on February 19, 1312. Rashid al-Din almost experienced the
same fate.
Soon afterwards, TÄj al-Din Ê¿Ali-ShÄh was appointed by the Emperor Uljeitu
to replace SaÊ¿d al-Din. From that time, because of the deep hatred and
rivalry between Ê¿Ali-ShÄh and Rashid al-Din, the vast Mongol Empire was
divided and administered by the two SÄhib DivÄns. Thus Ê¿Ali ShÄh became
responsible for northwestern *Persia, Mesopotamia, and Asia Minor, and
Rashid al-Din took charge of central and southern Persia. Eventually, the
enmity between the two viziers brought disaster to Rashid al-Din when he
was accused of having poisoned the Uljeitu. In an interesting account,
related mostly by KÄshÄni, Rashid al-Din was charged with murdering the
emperor by prescribing the wrong medicine. During his trial, his Jewish
background was mentioned very often. Rashid al-Din, when defending himself
against the accusation that he had poisoned Uljeitu, said: "How could I do
such a thing? I was a Jewish pharmacologist, a physician, a weak person who
rose to a high rank" (SuqÄÊ¿i 1974:183). Rashid al-Din and his 16-year-old
son, Ibrahim, were put to death in 1318 by the new emperor, Abu SaiÊ¿d, the
son of Uljeitu. Consequently, Rashid al-Din's property was confiscated and
RabÊ¿-i Rashidi was looted. Later on, one of Rashid al-Din's sons, GhiyÄth
al-Din, was appointed vizier to Abu SaÊ¿Ä«d (r. 1316â€“1335).
Rashid al-Din is considered one of the greatest scholars in Persia. Besides
Persian, he knew Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, and Mongolian languages. He
produced several monumental books, the most important of which was
JÄmiÊ¿al-TavÄrÄ«kh. The latter includes the history of the Mongols and
accounts relating to the history of many nations including the European
peoples. His production of the history of the Mongol and Turkish tribes
remains a single, uniquely valuable source until now. Regarding his
writings, including a commentary on *Koran, see S.H. Nasr et al. in the
bibliography below. About 80 years later, Rashid al-Din's body was
transferred from the Muslim graveyard and buried in the Jewish cemetery.

Yesterday, a delivery guy ringed in my condo. I took the lift
down and opened the door ... Suddently, there was something
ugly in front of me - I was scarred for a moment. It was his
face! He looked like a klingon, a black klingon. He noticed and said like
"I'm also a human being like you." ... Additionally a couple
of white guys standing nearby looked at me as upon a potential racist.
I almost said: "No, no conspecific life form of mine would become
a delivery guy." My kind forces its will upon the environment
including other life forms no matter biped or not. "human being like you"?

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Sarkozy>'s marriage to Jessica
Sebaoun-Darty <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darty>, the Jewish heiress,
touched off a controversy, after journalist Claude Askolovitch described
them as anti-Semitic <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Semitic>. The
magazine's editor, Philippe Val
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Val>, ordered SinÃ© to write a
letter of apology or face termination. The cartoonist said he would
rather "cut his own balls off," and was promptly fired. Both sides
subsequently filed lawsuits, and in December 2010, SinÃ© won a
40,000-euro <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro> court judgment against

For instance, the German PhD, Ijad Madisch, has founded a Facebook for
Science, ResearchGate,
because a grandfather from USA has given him money. And Angela Merkel
gave him a price
for being so stupid to move to Germany after having created a company.
If your question starts with "why" and is not addressed to yourself but
to somebody else,
then it means that your mind is abridged - you need external expertise.

BTW, what is the connection between Iran and kidneys? I am not kidding:

Thank you. As I googled, the price of a kidney is a subject for
scientific papers ... human decision making.
Like "What makes people sell their body parts (cheaper)?"
Regarding ME: Why would not Iran want to become world's oil (20%) and
hash supplier
number one -- enough money to "civilise" those tribes.
Iran is at least an Islamic nation familiar with the relevant experience
and the opposition to Israel, which makes Iran trustworthy to the "tribes".
Basically, Saudi Arabia would be knocked out as terrorist creator number
one.
Remember Afganistan under Soviet rule. If not Saudi Arabia, we would
have civilised them.
On the other side, I would even see a competition between Turkey and
Iran in offering a
"modernized Islamic culture" to the world.

No, Pouya, you are just a defeatist, who is unable to be proud of his

Putin is delivering S-400 to Iran. So that they can develop and

Then, US would rather allow the occupation of Iraq than nuclear war.

Ideas die because of pacifist egoism (= Ayn Rand).
Nobody wants anybody to success with his idea and rise with

But once the war started, egoism gets replaced by patriotism
and bad ideas are defeated by the reality of the battle field.

"Stalin's cruelty against his own people"
I stopped to watch from here on. Soviet soldiers sitting
in water filled trenches with ice crust had a tough
choice between
1) "sharing the scarce food with civilians, suffer malnutrition,
loose battle and let fascists exterminate civilians anyway"
2) "take civilian starvation in account, but defeat the fascists"
This propaganda has as always the goal
to run smear campaigns on Russian leaders in order
to steal resources after the trust in own leadership is destroyed.
USA has now more prisoners per population than the
highest estimates for Stalin.

Is this a bad joke? According to the nazi ideology, there should be a
racial struggle. Therefore the nazis decided to kill members of every
ethnic minority, which they regarded as "non-arian". This murderous
ideology was responsible for the deaths of millions of people. You are
probably deluded, if you make the statement, that the USSR should have
surrendered. This would have meant, that the nazis could have used more
people as slaves in their occupied territories and also would have
killed a lot because they thought, that Slavic, or in general many
soviet ethnicities were sub-humans. Do you even know, what that means?
If the Soviet government would have surrendered, the fascists could have
killed dozens of millions of the Soviet people and would have enslaved
them. So you dare to say "Stalin was every bit as cruel and brutal as
the nazis"? You know, that this accusation is completely made up by
right-wing liars, who want to portray their true enemy (communism) as
bad as fascism. There is absolutely no proof, that Stalin or his real
marxist-leninist comrades intended, to kill millions of people just for
not agreeing with them. You know why? Stalin knew, that his country
would be attacked in the future by aggressive imperialist states like
the third Reich. It would be stupid for him to devastate his country by
destroying the lives of millions. Stalin knew, that he has to be able to
prepare fully for the incoming war. Your next thesis is, that "
millions... suffered under Soviet occupation". This is complete
non-sense. You have to be totally non-informed to believe that Soviet
occupation was as bad as the fascist occupation. Do you even know, how
socialism functions and how the socialist states were organised? Or do
you believe cheap lies about the Soviet Union? The implementation of the
socialist system in these countries was a gigantic liberation in
comparison to the fascist rule. The countries were build up really fast
and all workers got workplaces from the socialist state. I hope, you go
ahead and inform yourself about these times and hope for you, that you
don't believe cheap alterations of historical truth in the future.

"Thereâ€™s a large spectrum of work under the name of â€œconsultingâ€. There
are great consulting firms and there are body shops that taken on the
lowest kind of work. Companies tend to give two types of work to
consultancies: the highest-end stuff that they might not have the right
people for, and the low-end dreck work that would be a morale-killer if
allocated to people theyâ€™d actually like to retain for a year or few.
Scrum is for the body shops, the ones that expect programmers to suffer
when client relationships are mismanaged and that will take on a lot of
low-end, career-incoherent work that no one wants to do."

Moldova one time wanted to join NATO so a delegation of NATO went to

Then they started discussing about the contribution that Moldova would
bring.
Than Moldovan Minister announced proudly :
"We will contribute one tank! "
The NATO General looked at each other and were not very excited... they
say that NATO is very big and needs a consistent number, one tank is to
little...
The Moldovan asked for time to consult each other, they went in another
room and were arguing there after much screaming they came back to the

"Ok we discussed and we finally agreed: We'll give you both our tanks!"

I agree. The Hungrians "revolutionaries" lynched people on streets ...
not sure if the US radio suggested such things.

NOT fascism are all the US funded rapists in Syria-Iraq-Yemen.

Hadi is a Syrian friend of mine. He came before the outbreak of the war.
He came as a student. Then, the war made a refuge out of him, while
he was in Germany. That must feel awful. He told me that Saudi Arabia
can finance this war for decades. Germany makes 10B $ on exports to
Saudi Arabia

How much of this profit is spent on side effects like "refugies"?

<p dir="ltr">Ordinary people = sheeple with fake humanity, who support NATO democratization wars, but call own white trash "fascists". It is not news, if 71 people die in Syraq, Jemen, Lybia ... But, in Austria, it is news. Germany has money and tries to hypnotise own sheeple to accept "refugies" = Untermensch. Why should not a Syrian be a traveller, a student or a worker in Germany? A proud human being? For you, Pouya, a gamma-male, being a proud human being is inimmaginable.</p>

<div class="quote"><p dir="ltr">Everybody has a kind of filter for&nbsp; perceptions, which defines what is important, good, bad, irrelevant. Certain things can not break through it. This "refugy problem" was irrelevant, until mainstream declared to be relevant. As I cycled only food and weather really mattered. But, once I am basically supplied I tend only to perceive abstract and global concepts. Others would concentrate on things they own and friends they connected to. Therefore it is difficult for me to communicate about things others can not perceive. It is summarized by "weltschmerz" in political issues.</p>
<div class="quote"><p dir="ltr">Did you recently buy a cheap flat in Germany, where only refugies would like to live in?</p>
<p dir="ltr">"welcomed and given hope" - that does NOT happen for refugies. Actually, Germany picks out the better ones and the rest is deported. The picked ones are properly debased after living in containers without work permission. Why does not Germany stop licking American ass? Most people want to live in their own country. Nobody wants to depend on charity. Even if you let some people stay after years of debasement, you still keep a lot of people out - this is injustice.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Russia has accepted 1mn Ukrainian refugies. They have SO MUCH space.</p>
<div class="quote">Look, Pouya pretends to be against humiliating innocent people like I
was while joining ProAsyl = "landlords4refugees"
I think I can generate one of his bullshits:
"These coward Greek people, who got so much help and support from
Germany, have no heart for refugees."
but once somebody robes him at a cash machine:
"These coward refugees! Germany should get rid of them. How can you
betray somebody, who helped you?"
Pouya, I found a journal for people of your restricted world perception.

I still try to get a second PhD.
I have recently noticed a development, which I would call "the sunset of
data science". Diagrams and plots are presented in corporate discussion
rooms, where more and more people appear, who use misleading rhetorics
to argument for decisions in own favor but not for the correct
consequences from the results. A lot of data scientists therefore lower
their analysis quality and simply care less. Additionally, there are
more and more people with no theoretical knowledge in machine learning,
who work as data scientists. I think that we need a new term for machine
learning people, who make "decision making systems without human
interferences".
I agree to use the word "boooooooring", although I would call it
differently.
In fact, the peak of human intelligence was 150T years ago.
Since then, people invented all these boooooooring cities with supply chains
and can write their "PhDs" in anorexia like this Laurie Penny.
Great data scientific work competes with astrology for attention
and astrology offers more "fun and drama". Even my dragon tale does. 
Keep calm and write decision making systems.
A copy of Daniel Suarez' books ... Alan, you should read real books.

By the way, all people complaining about or trying to spot a
"socio/psychopath", have been extremly stupid.
 

What if I tell you that all those psychological categories are just very
convincing
narratives? Things, which you can only prove by a questionary and not
measure.
I give you different narative.
Terms like "Psychopath", "Social Darwinism" and so on seem to be used by
losers only.
Now, I have created a new category "loser" and can make questions about
shifting the guilt upon psychopaths.

the Christian community has executed a female Greek mathematician
in Alexandria by skinning(!).

On the other side, the are islamic figures like Bamba Touba from Senegal,
who preached solidarity, hard work and asceticism.

I call it "Milgram trap" - you side with the evil with no return,
Also known under the name "altruistic punishment". 
The trick is very easy - you need a justifing narrative.
like "Blacks are subhumans"
Then you can watch "Hotel Rwanda" as a comedy and laugh every time
people get killed or horrified.

Gays are the return to the wild, pre-abrahamic way of life.
The logic consequence of technological progress
is to remove the gentiles completly. Sexuality is
to be erased and reproduction is to be completly controlled.
Abrahamic religions are the only ones, which had
this first idea of birth controll, which led them to success.

PS: It's is easier as a group than alone.
Alan, I do not know, what your current money source is.
But, if you search for such thing, then I would suggest you
following sheme:
You can get a freelance project no matter in US or Gemany
much easier, if you tell the customer that you are a member
of a team/company and we also would like to have more
people involved. I am serious - I even decline a "second PhD"
position in Bergen to make this thing run. You can keep, what
whatever you earn, but exchange experiences with us.
There is huge transformation in Germany running now -
we need to develop technologies, which could integrate
the incoming manpower into the labor force without
raising dissent. I think SchÃ¤uble will put tax on cheap
gasoline and pay for CCTV and more surveillance and
social media persuation. Do you have skype?
I want to enter your safe space and become one of the people, who supports you. Why don't you talk to me?

... fix refugees crisis in Berlin.

.... wait, I can imagine their *.ppt:
Next silver 1000x climacteric women will gather at train stations caving 
for male hands,
while 1000x police men will try save them. But German Breiviks became 5x

Whoever you talk on Facebook, it always feels like
you talk to a retard. FB puts like-Buttons on every
content, even on "my child died" - an intelligent person
turns into a retard, boosting dopamin level by "likes".
I just talked to Alan on FB. No, not him really. It was
a socially conform retarded version of him.
50+ people :-D
http://i.imgur.com/2SvpTAA.gif
Alan, maybe, we can talk over email again. Neither using FB is a sign of being "human" nor tipping waitors.

Hi Baraki, I have a question. When you go to the sauna, girls might confuse you with islamos? I am asking, because I have to visit Cologne soon and I can not pretend to be latino, when I am nacked.

Pouya, since it became normal in our society that lazy, stupid and
untalented people
justify their underachivements by fact that they belong to an
underprivileged group,
I tend to make very rough judgements about all the underpriviled groups.
Further, since every vocally active and frequently mentioned group
pretends to be
is assumed to be underpriviled, I instantly voice my judgement, whenever
a group
of people appears in conversation.
You have mentioned "women" and "immigrant with a sÃ¼dlÃ¤ndische appearance".
I think both groups try to get a better place in the economic food chain
by whatever arguments
except hard work.
I found a nice experience for you, so you can
feel a bit beyond states you normally feel.
Just switch on this music:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAGXWJZMCdg
listen for 60 sec and then slowly type in google imagesearch
"dark russian art"
 https://www.google.de/search?q=dark+russian+art&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjrtsiTydfKAhVFjQ8KHdfeBdAQ_AUIBygB&biw=1600&bih=719
then just go through the pictures


I have another one.
This music
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv7wCzdcHDc
totally underlines the boredom and banality in swipping girls on Tinder.
I know a German police woman, who uses Tinder
to find one night stand.
Even heterosexual girls want to fock her once they
see her in uniform.
But, you did not get the original idea of my message.
When I go through pictures pulled from social media into Tinder,
I have a certain feeling, which only music can
underline and make it enjoyable.
Another example:
When you switch death metal on, after listening
in for 60 sec then watch the disturbing liveleak
videos ... Like fat fish, which only tastes good
with lemon juice.

"robots might begin to learn the power of money"
.... like hiring a human killer over computer synthesized phone call? 
And then pay them in bitcoin.
no way. robots are dead things. only a living being can learn the power 
of anything.
Of cause, you can fantasize about bots taking control over human finance 
system by accident, but why?
A robot is not even afraid of death. Can a robot actually die?
A human and any other life form always to attempts to exterminate and if 
not possible to at least
dominate other life forms in maximum generations to come. You don't just 
procreate, you
try to create a new junction in the tree of life, a new race, which will 
hopefully dominate
everything on this planet. Fish breeds much more than humans, but we can 
exterminate
them all and replace by artificial meat.

I love to troll left-wing Turks who curse on German "nazis" with that:
"Accordingly, I have placed my death-head formations in readiness for 
the present only in the
East with orders to them to send to death mercilessly and without 
compassion, men, women,
and children of Polish derivation and language. Only thus shall we gain 
the living space /
(Lebensraum)/ which we need. Who, after all, speaks today of the 
annihilation of the Armenians?"
My plan is very simple: Greeks, Syrians, Kurds, Iraqis, Iranians, 
Armenians, Ossetians, Russians
and Hisbollah attack Turkey from all sides and get each a piece of it. 
But, Armenia gives Karabagh
back to Azerbaijan for supporting this plan. Armenia performs the same 
thing Poland did after
WWII - it shifts towards West.

Marcel trusted Fabian - his biggest mistake.
Pouya, why are you so negative about development of B2B content?
What is bad about selling .ppt? I think you are just arrogant.
Ok, you should give all your money
to charities, because you made it with
.ppt, .doc and .tex. Or did you make
money with a product? (A book is not
a product)
In 2013, I told Alan that MT
has the best position at Q, even
better than Henco. Therefore, he
is an example to follow. Now,
even you understood.
But, Pouya, why do you think
that writing PhD thesis and
mutually cited papers on government
money is less parasiting? Unversities
have been private family businesses
in the begging and made money on
lectures to the upper class. What did
your PhD supervisor do for the humanity?
Except having h-index? 

Which crisis? Banning paper money solves it.

I went to left may day picnick in Dresden. I expected at least this music 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ2XYNedgoc
But, there was this Claudia Kipping of withering fuckability in ugly red
jacket
talking about "We need to have more money in social issuances." (yes,
beg more!)
Then a drunk female creature of German origins yelled and called her
a "fascist cunt", and Claudia replied to the creature "We actually recruit
stammtisch-fighters!"
IF YOU WANT TO RULE A COUNTRY, THEN DON'T BE A PUSSY!


Her Name is actually Katia Kipping and not Claudia. None of you
noticed that I tried to hear more about Claudia at Q.
Pouya, since Tsipras' pseudo-left betrayal, people don't trust
the "European Left". Now, every party is left-wing in comparison with Islam.
Look, if according to the iron law of oligarchy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_law_of_oligarchy
there will be 0.1%, which will rule the world despite all democratic
precautions especially considering current technology, then
we need a leadership the people can trust.
The current German leadership mildews and bums around
and most Germans already noticed it. I talked to many people.
They don't care about ideologies anymore. They want
a peaceful constructive leadership with values of solidarity, diligence and
modesty.

If Pouya or anybody else of you thinks that
Pouya is genious, he should start to question
his own sanity.
German system trasfers money from working
singles to families with or without an employed parent today
and does not even garantee a proper pension in the future.
Pouya does not fock, he makes other people's focking cheaper
and will be focked as a retiree.

  "This video is not available in your country.

An idiotic chorus tries to destroy the "Militant Free-minded Male" - the

"Militant Free-Minded Male" is always the driving positive force in all

Nazis have been fucktards, not male. Hitler ordered his soldiers to not
engage in relationships on East front. Otherwise, Hitler would win like 
Mohamed.
But, Mohammed is dead now and his sublimated quran/sperm is outdated.
Who belongs to this idiotic chorus? All Liberal Left, Bronze Age 
Ideologists (Imams and Rabbis) and
free market fetishists (or rather anal greedy parasites).

The human development goes towards more and more control of sexual activity.

artificial womb and shut down sexuality completely. You as a full genome

An Iranian will never be an MP in UK.
Ethnic diversity is a good thing, but Shariah-fascism is a bad one

Baraki, you incomplete
I just discovered two things on youtube, which are
even more disgusting than things on liveleak:
"feminist cringes" and "islam drinking urine"
CoS uses electrodes ... just imagined Martin :D
By the way, there is a huge wave of refugee
soon coming over Italy. The causes lie in the world
economy. The asylum law is a symptomatic
measure, does not cure the cause and has massive
side effects like even worsening the cause.
Iranian women protest against Claudia's scarf

ISIS realised that harvesting organs of even own
fighters is more reasonable than beheading,
burning alive and whatever. Funny
that somebody might get a jihadi heart transplanted.

Yes, Pouya! Exactly!
Now, we can become friends.
It is not just "western politician", it is "western left-wing politician"
Left-wing supports something, what oppresses women.
Alan,
Fabian is blond, he rather looks like this guy:

Did you watch the movie about Scientology?
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4257858/
This movie reminds me of Borat -- you see too much of disgusting things, 
which
get worse and worse.
"I read the book"
Actually, a lot of Germans now read Quran and Hadith. It is
even more disgusting. It is about a jew-slaughtering pedophile
misogynist warmongering analphabet urine drinking sadist(!).
.... Well, Francois de Sade lived after Mohammed and
had to be mohammedian.
I understood. I know that you would neither read Dianetics nor Marcel 
ThÃ¼rk's dissertation.

It is actually amazing, how common and accepted antisemitism is in Marroco
and Mauretania - even people, who hosted me. Being openly Jew is not really
safe there. But, this article is hilarious:

Alan, you surprised me with a spaceghetto style content ...
I explain at least for Alan, because he is outside of Germany, who Frauke Petry is. A female PhD, who wrote her thesis in Goettingen on technical matters and in Latex. Then gave birth to 4 kids and became Technology Enterpreneur having a factory now. And in addition such a great political troll. I even consider to join her right wing party. 
German press is making fun of her, because she said that there is a law that guns are ultimo ratio for border police. Ok, even GDR did not have such clear law. But, how many refuges have been shot on Mexacan border? Turkish border? 
I was and am pro-refugee, but having a functioning state enables Germany to help and there should not any illegal border crossing, since it undermines the state. If I do not listen to the police at US airport, they will shoot me, right?
My concern is the deislamisation as a subset of general Enlightenment. With liberal politics, you can not even deislamize people, who entered Germany. So, either you turn to Soviet style deislamisation politics or you "shut down the entry of moslems" as Trump puts it. 

Alan, I know now that oil/energy will not run out.
This Club of Rome's "Limits to Growth" is only true between 
technological breakthroughs.
We will go up the Kardashev Scale.
Alan, I don't know, what will happen with me on 26th.
Today, I spent 3 hours sitting in the court - damn retard lawyer and 
lawmakers!
There are laws, there are laws which override these laws, compete with 
each other and
there are books full of comments about laws, which are relevant. 
Basically, the judge can
take any text snippet and justify his decision in any direction he 
likes. Then, I mentioned
press and journalists and he suddenly found a common-sense solution.
The problem that people, who write laws have no coding experience. They 
create
huge complex systems (without even compiling) and then wait until something
goes wrong and fix it in a dirtiest way possible.

Me? Why? I did nothing.
undercover: yes, nazis: maybe
This time, it is Polish fraudsters.
Poland ... they are homophobic, support nazis in Ukraine, reject 
refugees, host US nukes,
buy Saudi oil for dumping prices, even piss off EU for being 
"undemocratic" ...
Oh, Baraki makes me laugh again!

Pouya, how much does the entry cost?
You hitting the right point, Bogdan. The lesbian, fatherlandless 
(vaterlandslos), evolutionary
deadend Dunja invites Frauke, and Frauke had to troll that.
By the way, I am preparing now for a polar expedition into Russia.
"Unfortunately I donï¿½t accept any Indian male students for internships.
We hear a lot about the rape problem in India which I cannot support. I
have many female friends in my group, so I think this attitude is
something I cannot support,"

Well, I am starting #PEGIVA ="/Patriotische EuropÃ¤er Gegen die Indische
Vergewaltingung des Abendlandes/"
Can't wait to lead a demonstration consisting of virgivitiphobic blondes.
I guest male Indian students will be welcome, once a law forces the
removal of their gentiles at airport.
Banning paper money is the one thing.
The other part of solution "to the crisis" is states buying own stocks.
http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-04-25/stunning-finding-bank-japan-now-top-10-holder-90-japanese-stocks
The solution is actually "central planning".
I would rather want to join the politburo than "pushing into products".

Why are the Qlaymis so silent? I have designed a new logo for you in

BTW, Alan .... Do you have your logo already?
I am not exactly in Bielefeld. Does my linkedin-photo look well?
If pouya is happy sending political bullshit, it means that he has

No, Albania will annex Greece - my troops already in position to execute

Russians and French .... and one Indian
Now, Pouya, listen:
"If voting changed anything, they'd make it illegal." Emma Goldman
In order to fight the oil price caused deflation, EU needs a reason to
pump money to Greece again.
And Obama expresses sympathy

And the haircut is coming
And the stuff, Russians not gona buy ... Greeks will buy.
So many things you can cover as democratic theater
